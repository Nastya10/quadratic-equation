# Solving Quadratic Equations
This program takes as input three coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and then returns the number of roots and their values.

## Testing
Program works in testing mode if macro ```TEST``` is defined.

## Building
[CodeBlocks project file](https://github.com/Nastya10/quadratic-equation/blob/main/solving_squares.cbp)
Use CodeBlocks IDE with g++ compiler in order to build it.
